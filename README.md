# Snake_Race
Use your arrow keys to move the blue snake to try to eat the apples. You're competing against the red snake, which is controlled by a simple AI controller. Whenever one snake eats an apple, that snake grows by three squares, while the other snake shrinks by one square. If a snake shrinks to zero, it loses the game. Also, if either snake collides with itself or its opponent, it loses the game. If snakes collide head-on, then the longest snake wins. You can restart the game by refreshing the page.
